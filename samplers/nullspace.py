    The algorithm used by this function is based on the singular value
    decomposition of `A`.

    A : ndarray
        A should be at most 2D.  A 1D array with length k will be
        treated as a 2D with shape (1, k)
    atol : float
        The absolute tolerance for a zero singular value.  Singular
        values smaller than `atol` are considered to be zero.
    rtol : float
        The relative tolerance.  Singular values less than rtol*smax are
        considered to be zero, where smax is the largest singular value.

    If both `atol` and `rtol` are positive, the combined tolerance is
    the maximum of the two; that is: tol = max(atol, rtol * smax)
    Singular values smaller than `tol` are considered to be zero.

    ns : ndarray
        If `A` is an array with shape (m, k), then `ns` will be an array
        with shape (k, n), where n is the estimated dimension of the
        nullspace of `A`.  The columns of `ns` are a basis for the
        nullspace; each element in numpy.dot(A, ns) will be
        approximately zero.
